    conference_short: Course Project
    conference: Developed a multi-modal AI assistant that integrates language processing, image generation, and speech recognition capabilities using LocalAI and Gradio. The assistant facilitates interactive conversations, generates images from textual prompts, understands and responds to voice commands, summarizes document content, and classifies images. This project provided me a valuable insights into project management and multi-model integration.

      This Web program aims to alleviate foreign travelers' language barriers by providing an intuitive interface for dish recommendations, translations, and cultural insights. The core solution addresses the pain point of ordering unfamiliar cuisines or lacking multilingual context when traveling. Leveraging a dish database enhanced by LLM, it delivers context-aware suggestions, translations, and tags (e.g., “Spicy”, “Vegetarian”) in multiple languages to guide user choices. The backend is designed in Django.
