## About me

I am currently a **Second-year** undergraduate student at the **School of Software, Tsinghua University**, guided by [Prof. Feng Xu](http://xufeng.site/). My research interests lie primarily in **Computer Vision** and **Graphics** . I am passionate about exploring more research areas.
Please feel free to contact me!



## Education
**2022.09-2026.06 | B.E. Software Engineering, [School of Software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)**

## Research Experience

**2023.03-2023.07 | Quality of Experience(QoE) Improvement in Mobile Live Streaming Program**  
I joined the Student Research Training program: QoE Improvement in Mobile Live Streaming, adviced by [Prof. Lifeng Sun](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1180/4034.htm). In this project, I extensively searched and read relevant literature, and attempted to implement a method for evaluating video streaming hotspots through C++, fanally applied to the adaptive bitrate system in our laboratory.

**2023.08-2024.05 | 3D human body reconstruction based on inverse rendering**  
This project is co-supervised by [Prof. Feng Xu](http://xufeng.site/) and [Wenbin Lin]([http://xufeng.site/](https://wenbin-lin.github.io/)), focusing on the reconstruction of real-time human body movements, mesh and lighting textures from a sparse perspective. Specifically, what I am doing in this project is to use a small number of mobile phone videos as input, to estimate the posture of the human and render it into a mesh model in real time. I hope to publish a paper for this work.



## Awards
**2023.09 | I won the 2023 Hantex Scholarship in Tsinghua University**
