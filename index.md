## About me

I am currently a **Third-year** undergraduate student at the **School of Software, Tsinghua University**, guided by [Prof. Jiachen Li](https://jiachenli94.github.io/). My current research interests lie primarily in **Reinforcement Learning** and **Social Aware Agents**. I am also passionate about exploring more research areas.
Please feel free to contact me!

## Education
**2022.09-2026.06 | B.E. Software Engineering, [School of Software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)**

## Research Experience

**2024.06- | Multi-Robot Social Navigation with Cooperative Occupancy Prediction**  
Directed by [Prof. Jiachen Li](https://jiachenli94.github.io/). In this project, I introduced a novel multi-robot social navigation system that integrates **cooperative perception** from autonomous driving into **multi-agent reinforcement learning**. Under Prof. Jiachen Li's guidance, I had the opportunity to lead a small research group for the first time, which was a memorable experience. The paper related to this project is currently under review.

**2023.08-2024.05 | On-the-fly Feature Aggregation for Real-time Free-viewpoint Dynamic Human Video from Sparse Views**  
This project is directed by [Prof. Feng Xu](http://xufeng.site/) and [Wenbin Lin](https://wenbin-lin.github.io/), focusing on the reconstruction of real-time human body movements, mesh, and lighting textures from sparse perspectives. Specifically, I utilize a small number of mobile phone videos as input to estimate human posture and render it into a mesh model in real time. The paper related to this project is currently under review.

**2023.03-2023.07 | Quality of Experience(QoE) Improvement in Mobile Live Streaming Program**  
I joined the Student Research Training program: QoE Improvement in Mobile Live Streaming, advised by [Prof. Lifeng Sun](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1180/4034.htm). In this project, I extensively searched and reviewed relevant literature, and implemented a method for evaluating video streaming hotspots using C++. This method was finally applied to the adaptive bitrate system in our laboratory.

## Awards
**2024.10 | Received the Weng Scholarship at Tsinghua University**
**2023.09 | I won the 2023 Hantex Scholarship in Tsinghua University**
