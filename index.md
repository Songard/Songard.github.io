## About me

I am currently a **Second-year** undergraduate student at the **School of Software, Tsinghua University**, guided by [Prof. Feng Xu](http://xufeng.site/). My research interests lie primarily in **Computer Vision** and **Graphics** . I am passionate about exploring more research areas.
Please feel free to contact me!



## Education

### **2022.09-2026.06 | B.E. Software Engineering, [School of Software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) **



<!-- {% include_relative _includes/publications.md %} -->
## Experience

<!-- - **[Feb. 2020]** Our paper about incremental learning is accepted to CVPR 2020. -->
**2023.03-2023.07 | Quality of Experience(QOE) Improvement in Mobile Live Streaming Program**
I joined the Student Research Training program: **User Experience Improvement in Mobile Live Streaming**, adviced by [Prof. Lifeng Sun](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1180/4034.htm). In this project, I extensively searched and read relevant literature, and attempted to implement a method for evaluating video streaming hotspots through C++, fanally applied to the adaptive bitrate system in our laboratory.

**2023.08-2024.05 | 3D human body reconstruction based on inverse rendering**
This project is co-supervised by [Prof. Feng Xu](http://xufeng.site/) and [Wenbin Lin]([http://xufeng.site/](https://wenbin-lin.github.io/)), focusing on the reconstruction of real-time human body movements, mesh and lighting textures from a sparse perspective. Specifically, what I am doing in this project is to use a small number of mobile phone videos as input, to estimate the posture of the human and render it into a mesh model in real time.

## Awards

**2023.09 | I won the 2023 Hantex Scholarship**
