## About me

I am currently a **Third-year** undergraduate student at the **School of Software, Tsinghua University**, guided by [Prof. Jiachen Li](https://jiachenli94.github.io/) . My current research interests lie primarily in **Reinforcement Learning** and **Social Robots**. I am also passionate about exploring more research areas.
Please feel free to contact me!

## Education
**2022.09-2026.06 \|   B.E. Software Engineering, [School of Software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)**

## Research Experience

**2024.06- | Multi-Robot Social Navigation with Cooperative Occupancy Prediction**  
I went to the [TASL](http://tasl.ucr.edu/) at the University of California, Riverside as a visiting scholar to conduct this research under the guidance of [Prof. Jiachen Li](https://jiachenli94.github.io/). In this project, we integrated cooperative perception methods into a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to address social navigation tasks using Occupancy Grid Map Prediction (OGMP). Our approach resulted in performance enhancements in navigating complex environments with multiple agents. Through this experience, I gained a understanding of reinforcement learning and social navigation tasks, as well as skills in communicating and leading research within a diverse team.



**2023.08-2024.05 | Feature Aggregation for Real-time Free-viewpoint Dynamic Human Video from Sparse Views**  
This project is directed by [Prof. Feng Xu](http://xufeng.site/) and [Wenbin Lin](https://wenbin-lin.github.io/), focusing on the reconstruction of real-time human body movements, mesh, and lighting textures from sparse perspectives. Specifically, I utilize a small number of mobile phone videos as input to estimate human posture and render it into a mesh model in real time. The paper related to this project is currently under review.

**2023.03-2023.07 | Quality of Experience(QoE) Improvement in Mobile Live Streaming Program**  
I joined the Student Research Training program: QoE Improvement in Mobile Live Streaming, advised by [Prof. Lifeng Sun](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1180/4034.htm). In this project, I extensively searched and reviewed relevant literature, and implemented a method for evaluating video streaming hotspots using C++. This method was finally applied to the adaptive bitrate system in our laboratory.

## Awards & Scholarships
**2024.10 \|   Received the Weng Scholarship at Tsinghua University.**


**2023.09 \|  I won the 2023 Hantex Scholarship**
